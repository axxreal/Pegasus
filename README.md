# Pegasus.py - Discord Bot DM Spammer

## Overview
**Pegasus.py** is a Python script that facilitates direct message spamming on Discord using multiple bot tokens. The script randomly selects a bot token and sends a message to a specified user ID in a threaded manner.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (`python --version`).
3. Install the required modules by running the bat file.
4. Create a `tokens.txt` file with your Discord bot tokens (one token per line).
5. Run the script: `python pegasus.py`.

## Configuration
- **tokens.txt:** Add your Discord bot tokens to this file, with each token on a new line.

## Disclaimer
Use Pegasus.py responsibly and in compliance with Discord's terms of service. Excessive or abusive use may result in actions against your Discord account.
